# 🎉 Fun Project (testing)

This repository is created just for **fun, experimenting, learning, and trying random ideas**.  
Nothing serious — just vibes, creativity, and small experiments.

## 🤹 What’s inside?

- Random code experiments  
- HTML / CSS / JS practice  
- UI ideas  
- Testing features  
- Learning new stuff  
- Anything I feel like making for fun

## 🚀 Purpose

This repo exists so I can freely **explore**, **test**, and **improve** without any pressure.  
A playground to try out whatever comes to mind.

## 🛠️ Tech I might use

- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  
- Anything else I feel like trying  

## 😎 Notes

This repo changes often — expect random commits, new files, deleted files, and surprises.
